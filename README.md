# Heap Sort
Heap Sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for remaining element.

## Complexity
| Best | Average | Worst | Memory | Stable |
|------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| nlogn | nlogn     | nlogn   | 1      | No    |

- The worst-case time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn).
- The best-case time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn).
- The average case time complexity of heap sort is O(nlogn).
- The space complexity of heap sort is O(1).
